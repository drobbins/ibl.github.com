IBL website
===========

This is a collaborative effort by the members of the Integrative Bioinformatics
Laboratory (IBL), directed by Jonas Almeida, to maintain a website that links
to anything that can further the group's mission and research objectives. The
website is available at [http://ibl.github.io](http://ibl.github.io).
